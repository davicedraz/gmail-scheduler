# Google Apps Script - Schedule to send emails periodically 

This script aims to take advantage of all the abstraction contained within the use of the [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) platform, that makes easier to create and publish add-ons in an online store for Google Calendar, Docs, Slides, and Forms.

## Why do you need that?

You may have a repeated email that needs to be sent periodically. A reminder email, a report with summarized data from an excel spreadsheet, or a confirmation email after an event on your calendar?

Google App Scripts is integrated with all the APIs of your google account, from your spreadsheets and documents to your YouTube and Gmail account.

Using this integration, this script was made to send the same email (updating only the date) after verifying the occurrence of a Google Calendar event. Feel free to use this as a boilerplate and integrate with other APIs.

## Usage
```
Just copy, paste & run!
```
